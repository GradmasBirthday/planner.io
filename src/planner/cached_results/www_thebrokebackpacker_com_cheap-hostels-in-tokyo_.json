    "description": "Not only one of the best budget hostels in Tokyo but arguably one of the coolest, CITAN Hostel is awash with on-point aesthetics and multiple additional extras. The main draw to this place is that it\u2019s home to a vibrant restaurant and bar down in the basement. Coupled with its ground-floor coffee shop Berth, it\u2019s the perfect place to mingle with travelers and locals alike. The industrial-style rooms are cool and simple, but this hostel focuses mainly on the social aspect. It\u2019s also super clean, but that\u2019s standard for all of Japan's hostels.",

    "description": "Toco Tokyo Heritage Hostel isn\u2019t just budget-friendly, it\u2019s the chance for you to stay in an old-school Japanese house and live out your anime fantasies to the max. It\u2019s set in a traditional wooden house built in 1920, but it was been lovingly renovated recently into the awesome space it is today. Boasting beautiful private rooms and calm, cosy dorms, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to not enjoy staying here. Throughout the hostel, the spaces are utterly immaculate, including the ramshackle-style bar and lounge where even locals stop by for a drink or two. The stunning garden is a slice of serenity and an amazing place to chill out. Spend your time sitting on the veranda, drinking tea and looking out onto this mossy oasis. There\u2019s even a mini mountain made with rocks from Mount Fuji itself. What\u2019s not to love?",

    "name": "Unplan Shinjuku",
    "description": "This place opened in 2019 as the second location of the burgeoning Unplan franchise. The whole message behind this place is to go with the flow, as well as providing budget backpackers the chance to stay in Tokyo for cheap. Seriously though, this hostel is pretty dang cool. The social spaces are nicely thought out and very roomy, so you won\u2019t feel cramped. There are actually quite a few different places to hang out, from the lounge complete with a modern kitchen to the dining area, and the amazing rooftop terrace. This is the perfect place for a few drinks with a view of the city, especially at night when it\u2019s all lit up. But the communal areas aren\u2019t the only thing to celebrate. The dorms are also noteworthy, with large, comfortable pod-style beds giving you privacy to relax. This combo of peace-and-quiet twinned with a fairly sociable vibe easily makes this one of Tokyo\u2019s best budget hostels.",

    "description": "Almond Hostel & Cafe is possibly the cutest hostel in Tokyo. Known for its ground floor cafe which is a top spot for coffee and snacks, this place is all about having a chill, aesthetically pleasing base for your travels. The atmosphere is something that\u2019s particularly great about this hostel. It\u2019s got an easygoing vibe which really helps to make you feel welcome \u2013 think chilled music playing and friendly staff. Aside from that, however, the dorms themselves are super comfy and peaceful. With a minimalist aesthetic to match the vibe of the place, you\u2019ll get your own pod-style cubby hole to sleep in, complete with power sockets, lights and privacy curtains.",
